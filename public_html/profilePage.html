  <h1>Goku</h1>
  <p class="title">Son Goku, a Saiyan who was reared on Earth and was given the name Kakarot, serves as Dragon Ball's overarching primary character. Kakarot, who was originally taken to Earth as an infant, was adopted by Grandpa Gohan, who gave him the name Son Goku. An e arly head injury changed Goku's memory, erasing his initial tendency toward destruction and enabling him to mature into one of Earth's finest defenders. He works tirelessly to become the best fighter he can be, and by doing so, he has repeatedly prevented the annihilation of the Earth and the cosmos. No one beats Goku.</p>
